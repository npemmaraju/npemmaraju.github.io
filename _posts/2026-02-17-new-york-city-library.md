New York City's public libraries are one of the city's best-kept secrets. 
Free, warm, and full of character — they're so much more than places to borrow books.

Walking into the main branch on 5th Avenue feels like stepping into a different era. 
The ceilings soar, the light pours in through tall windows, and somehow it's both 
hushed and alive at the same time.

Beyond the flagship, the branch libraries scattered across the boroughs each have 
their own personality. Some are tucked into brownstones, others are airy modern spaces. 
All of them are free.

*A quieter neighborhood branch — the kind of place you discover by accident and keep coming back to.*

What I love most is that the library belongs to everyone. Students, retirees, tourists, 
regulars — all sharing the same space, reading, thinking, just existing together.
