Hi! I'm **Narayani**, an MS Data Science student at NYU specializing in Biomedical Data Science. 
I'm broadly interested in data science in Fintech and Healthcare.

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Hochwagen Lab, at New York University. 

Previously, I studied Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, and have interned at American Express 
and the University of Tartu. Outside of work, I love exploring New York City through my camera lens 
and playing instruments.
